# HUNTPROFIT
This is a Tibia fanmade application used to calculate the profit of your hunts and teamhunts and to have a full record of your past hunts.

The record of the Hunts is shown in a table, showing Data like: Respawn, Date, Wastes, Loot, Balance, Profit/Each, The transfers everyone should get, and if it is already paid or not.

It automatically detects how many people participated in the hunt, so you can split the profit.

## For doing all the math:
First, each person waste is paid, and then, after spliting the hunt balance by 2, 3 or 4 (for each person), it adds the profit per person to the waste.

## Here's an example of a 3 people hunt:
* EK waste: 105k
* ED waste: 328k
* RP waste: 112k
	* TOTAL WASTE:545

* Loot: 945k
* BALANCE: 400k

* Profit/each = 400/3 = 133,33k

* EK transfer: 238.33k (105waste + 133,33profit)
* ED transfer: 461.33k (328waste + 133,33profit)
* RP transfer: 245.33k (112waste + 133,33profit)
